    When creating a new issue, the plugin can populate the assignee with the
    default assignee you've chosen above, so that it'll be visible even before
    you've created the issue. It works only if Override Category Assignee is enabled.
    However, when you change certain fields, the form
    is reloaded and the default assignee is recalculated. This might be what you
    want, or it might be undesirable, so you can make the choice yourself:
  interactive_assignment: "Set Assignee Interactively"
  label_user: "User"
  none_selected: "<None>"
  self_assignment: "Assign issue author"
  self_assignment_explanation: >
    When a new issue is created with no assignee, and the project has no default
    assignee set, tick the box below to assign the issue to the user who just
    created the issue, if possible. If the box is left unticked, there will be
    no assignee, which is the default behaviour in Redmine.
